# Generative-Modeling

Generating samples from Fashion MNIST and MNIST datasets to learn high dimensional Density Estimation using Gaussian kernels 

### MNIST 
Modeled the whole dataset using 10, 100, 60 component Gaussian Mixtures : the generated points aren't that good \
Modeled using a 10 compoenent Mixture where each component is a 100 component Gaussian Mixture and sampled from each of the 10 component : generated points are great even just by using 2k samples 

### Fashion MNIST
Will have to try the second thing later. Bored!

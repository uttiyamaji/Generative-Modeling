# Generative-Modeling

### MNIST 

##### Estimating the density of MNIST dataset using Gaussian kernels and generating from it 
Modeled the whole dataset using 10, 100, 60 component Gaussian Mixtures : the generated points aren't that good \
Modeled using a 10 compoenent Mixture where each component is a 100 component Gaussian Mixture and sampled from each of the 10 component : generated points are great even just by using 2k samples 

### Fashion MNIST
Will have to try the second thing later. Bored!


### Neural Style Transfer
Not exactly generative modeling, but tried to see how it works \
My profile photo blended with Pablo Picasso's one art and Refik Anadol's one, separately.
